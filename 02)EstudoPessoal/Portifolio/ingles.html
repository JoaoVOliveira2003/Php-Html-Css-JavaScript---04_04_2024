    <p> Hello! I'm João Oliveira. <br>
      I'm from the chilly lands of southern Brazil, to be more specific, from Colombo in the greater Curitiba area.
      <br>I'm a junior programmer, and through this portfolio, my goal is to showcase
      <br>my knowledge and projects I've already developed.
      <br>The design and structure of this page were inspired by Wikipedia pages
      <br>(please Wikipedia, don't sue me hehe)
      <br>This portfolio is divided into several "chapters,"
      <br>namely:
      <br><i><b>-The technologies I work with</b></i> and my level of expertise in each.
      <br><i><b>-The languages I speak</b></i> and my level of fluency.
      <br><i><b>-Projects</b></i> completed.
      <br><i><b>-Professional experience</b></i> (lol: I'm looking for my first job in the field).
      <br><i><b>-Academic qualifications</b></i>.
      <br><i><b>-Licenses and certifications</b></i>.
      <br><i><b>-Contact information</b></i>.
  </p>
      </p>

  <h2>Known Technologies</h2>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p> &nbsp; There are various ways to rate something, using numbers from 1 to 10 or concepts like A, B, C, and D. Personally, I don't believe it's scientifically accurate to quantify the extent of knowledge I possess in a particular field. So, I will demonstrate it through sentences that attempt to convey my level of proficiency in the respective tool:</p>
  <br>
  

  <p>
    <b>SON</b> - Only the name<br>
    I have never studied about a certain area, I just know the name vaguely.<br>
    <b>SAC </b> - Some things on the surface<br>
    I know some things on the surface.<br>
    <b>MEG</b> - I'm confident<br>
    Even though I'm not an expert, I'm confident in the development of the area.<br>
    <b>GDC</b> - Genius of California<br>
    Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are currently fighting to see who will hire me.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    C - MEG <br>
    C++ - SAC <br>
    C# - SAC <br>
    JavaScript - SAC <br>
    HTML - MEG <br>
    CSS - MEG <br>
    <div class="ladin">
      Java - SAC <br>
      Python - SAC <br>
      Diagram creation - MEG <br>
      SQL - SAC <br>
      Android - SON <br>
      Canva - MEG <br>
    </div>
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Just like with technologies, I've used abbreviations here to demonstrate my proficiency level.<br>
   
    <b>NSN</b> - Not much knowledge<br>
    I don't know much, just some random phrases.<br>
    <b>SAC</b> - Some things on the surface<br>
    I can mumble some things that make sense in this language.<br>
    <b>MEG</b> - I'm confident<br>
    Even though I'm not fluent, if I were thrown into that country, I know I would be able to communicate.<br>
    <b>FLU</b> - Fluent<br>
    I'm confident in writing, speaking, pronunciation, reading, and listening comprehension.<br>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Portuguese - FLU <br>
    Spanish - MEG <br>
    English - MEG <br>
    German - SAC <br>
    French - NSN <br>
    Chinese - NSN <br>
    Japanese - NSN <br>
  </p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p><b>Observatory of Sustainable Development in Colombo</b><br>
    May 2023 - Present <br>
    The observatory is an organization that analyzes and seeks solutions to sustainability problems, and my mission within the observatory is to create a digital platform for them (a website), and this is the project I am dedicating the most attention to.
    In progress
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <b>Receipt Creation Software</b> <br>
    This is a software that creates a receipt, which can be downloaded in PDF format later. 
    (The receipt style needs updating, but the rest is working!)
    Used CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. <br>

    target="_blank">See the code here on Github!. </a>

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <b>Website for the Company "Assoalhos Modelo"</b>
    <br>
    The owner of Assoalhos Modelo needed a website to showcase their products. I created additional screens to showcase some more themes. I should make some modifications:<br>
    1- Remove the "monkey" image from the home screen and replace it with a horizontal photo of a service from Assoalhos Modelo. <br>
    2- Improve the description in "About Us" and especially in the services section. <br>
    Also, publish the site online someday.
    Skills: HTML5 · CSS · Canva · Graphic Design · JavaScript <br>

  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p>So far, I have not had the opportunity for my first paid job, but I have had some experiences that have helped me through activities.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Telephone Secretary at Assoalhos</b> <br>
    I answer the phone and create receipts. Since it's a family job, I don't consider it a job, but rather as family help.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Researcher, Basic Robotics Teacher, High School Computer Science Student</b><br>
    High school provided me with important experiences for my personal, academic, and professional life, so I mention them here.
